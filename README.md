Contribution
we tried lot of things 
Everyone in my team discussed
each person divided some parts the code
one person taken the logic part
one will taken the coding part
after we divided the assignment again we combine together we did the coding

Instruction to run the program
To run this program we need eclipse or anyother software related to Java IDE
create class name as "Asn03G37P02.java"
copy the code 
run the program

Challenges faced 
We dont know how to do in intial stage 
we gathered some information about the Heap sort
After we got to know about the how to sort 
while we are sorting its coming in ascending order from smallest to largest
and we got to know we implemented ascending order
again we changed the "<" to ">"
After changing the sign we got correct output
but output of sorted array is not seperated by ","
so we converted into Arrays to String 

we get the knowledge of how to face the risky coding
we faced new problems 
problems turned to our solutions 
solutions turned to our Knowledge
